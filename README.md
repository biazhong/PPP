Directory "Code for Section 7.1" contains all the java code that is used to conduct the numerical experiments listed in Section 7.1 of the paper entitled "Speeding Up Paulson's Procedure for Large-Scale Problems Using Parallel Computing"

Directory "Code for Section 7.2" contains all the code that is used to conduct the numerical experiments listed in Section 7.2 of the paper entitled "Speeding Up Paulson's Procedure for Large-Scale Problems Using Parallel Computing".

NOTE: The parallel computing platform we used in the paper is MPICH-3.3.2 which can be downloaded from https://www.mpich.org/.
NOTE: In the directory "Code for Section 7.2", we implement different procedures bascally use C++ and in each procedure, we highlight the parameters that should be changed from one problem instance by another by commenting the parameter by "Input Parameter:..."


The csv file "Numerical Results.csv" contains all the numerical results for the experiments we have conducted for the paper entitled "Speeding Up Paulson's Procedure for Large-Scale Problems Using Parallel Computing". It includes the exact numerical results for the experiments whose results are displayed in figures.
